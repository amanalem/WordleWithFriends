## Major Hurdles
* My biggest hurdle was figuring out all of the color logic. First, if the solution word was "crest" and the player guessed "chess," I needed to make sure that the second "S" in "guess" showed up as grey in the game grid, but still showed up as green in the keyboard at the bottom of the screen that keeps track of all of the guessed letters. I ended up redoing my code and then redoing it again. Ultimately, my final solution was always much simpler than my innitial ones.

## Unsolved Issues
* There is an issue where hitting the return key instead of clicking the enter button breaks my styling and brings up multiple guess textboxes and guess submit buttons.
* The game looks horrible on smaller screens. This is something I will look to improve in the future.
